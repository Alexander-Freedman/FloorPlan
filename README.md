## Overview

Floor Plan Optimizer is a simple web-based tool created for a floor installation company to help installers and designers clean up architectural floor plan PDFs. By removing text layers and preserving only the linework, it produces streamlined, annotation-free plans ready for further processing or CAD conversion.

## Features

* **PDF Upload & Preview:** Select and preview your floor plan PDF directly in the browser.
* **Text Removal:** Uses a Photopea script to strip away all text layers, leaving only the original linework intact.
* **Download & Save:** Download the cleaned PDF or save it locally using the browser's Save As functionality.

## Getting Started

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Use the **Choose File** button to select your floor plan PDF.
4. Click **Process PDF** to clean the plan.
5. Once processing completes, download the cleaned PDF via the **Download** button or use **Save As**.
